    Analysis of the detection slice by checking the brightness of the pixels

    :param detections: list of detections
    :param bright_pixels (int) : maximum number of bright pixels on the slice (wycinek)
    :param threshold (int) â€“ value of pixels for the bright_pixel (i.e bright pixel is when pixel have value >70)


    The code from "frame_content" is downloaded and saved as a disk image, loaded by functions from the "Image" library 
    and converted to gray scale LA (convert 'LA') - (8-bit pixels, black and white) with ALPHA. 
    After conversion, we analyze pixel by pixel counting bright pixels according to the given threshold, 
    at the end we count how many bright pixels were checking for more than the number of bright pixels, 
    if we classify more as an artifact.


    Required keys:
      * ``frame_content``: base64 image our detection

    Keys will be add:
      * ``BRIGHT_PIXELS``: number of bright pixels
      * ``GOOD_BRIGH``: True,or False.
